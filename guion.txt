Deckard is looking at Batty.

Batty is partly crumpled, frozen in an unnatural posi-
tion as though he had been writhing and stopped mid-
writhe.  He looks back at Deckard with eyes full of
life and intensity.

They stare at each other for a long time in silence,
communicating something with their eyes... without
expression.  Finally Batty breaks the silence.

                        BATTY
          Gauzak ikusi ditut                 
	  (geldialdi luzea)
          gauzak zuek jende txikia sinistuko 
	  ez zenutenak... Attack ships
          on fire off the shoulder of Orion
          bright as magnesium... I rode on
          the back decks of a blinker and
          watched c-beams glitter in the dark
          near the Brandenburger Toar.
                 (pause)
          all those moments... they'll be gone.

Batty holds Deckard's eyes like a hypnotist.

EXT. THE SECOND ROOF (A LITTLE LATER)

Batty is crumpled in a different position.  It's light-
er now and Batty's eyes are staring into infinity...
almost lifelessly.  A pigeon flutters down and perches
on his shoulder.  Batty doesn't stir.

Deckard is watching motionless.

The pigeon flies off.

Batty doesn't move.  Alive or dead?

EXT. THE SECOND ROOF - DAWN

A more distant perspective.  Deckard is a small figure
looking down at the dead body of Batty.

                        DECKARD (V.O.)
          I watched him die all night.  It
          was a long, slow thing and he
          fought it all the way.  He never
          whimpered and he never quit.  He
          took all the time he had... as
          though he loved life very much...
          every second of it... even the
          pain. He loved not only his life but all lives
	  Hi ha molta maldat en aquest món!
